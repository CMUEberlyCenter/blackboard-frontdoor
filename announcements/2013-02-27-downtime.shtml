      <h1>Dear Blackboard Community,</h1>

      <p>
	We apologize for the recent series of Blackboard outages and
        for any disruption to your academic work this may have
        caused. The reliability of the Blackboard system and related
        services is of utmost importance to us. Unfortunately,
        problems with the back-end systems have brought down
        Blackboard services much too frequently of late. OTE's
        Blackboard Support Team and Computing Services technical
        infrastructure teams are working together toward a
        solution. We would like to inform you about what's been
        happening and how we are working to remedy the situation.
      </p>
       
      <h2>Technical description of the problem:</h2> 
      <p>
	Computing Services uses Storage Area Network (SAN) technology
       to support shared disk environments for virtual and physical
       hosts at CMU. Our hosted instance of Blackboard uses this
       storage system. Recently, there have been disk failures
       on the SAN volumes. When these failures occur, the Blackboard
       connections to the SAN volumes also fail, causing your actions
       in Blackboard to hang and, ultimately, the front-end service to
       drop altogether. These recent Blackboard outages are all
       related to this particular system failure.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        NOTE: When a problem occurs, some of you will send us email
        reports describing the problems you've encountered and the
        errors you received while trying to access Blackboard. We
        appreciate this! Your reports help us to troubleshoot the
        problems. In addition, we have monitoring services in place to
        let us know when Blackboard is failing.
      </p>

      <h2>Short-term actions to address the problem:</h2>
      <p>
        As soon as an alert is raised, the team immediately begins to
        work on the back-end systems to restore services as quickly as
        possible. However, there is time-intensive work that goes on
        behind the scenes to restore the SAN volume connections to
        Blackboard and thus, to bring it back online for your use.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        NOTE: Until the underlying problem is resolved, here are some
        short-term suggestions.<br>
        <strong>Students:</strong> We encourage you to conduct your
        Blackboard-related work as much in advance as possible and not
        to rely on Blackboard access at the last minute.<br>
        <strong>Instructors:</strong> Offering some flexibility on
        student deadlines when there has been an unexpected Blackboard
        outage may be worth considering. You can find a record of this
        semester's downtimes
        at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/blackboard/downtime/">http://www.cmu.edu/blackboard/downtime/</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Actions being taken to resolve the underlying problem:</h2>
      <p>
        We are working to address the underlying problem and restore
        Blackboard to our high standard of system reliability. To
        accomplish this, Computing Services has acquired new SAN
        technology software and hardware. They have installed the new
        SAN volumes and are working through a series of tests on this
        new SAN infrastructure. Once testing is complete, we will
        schedule a Blackboard downtime maintenance window to
        transition/connect Blackboard to the new SAN technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will schedule this changeover to minimize impact on
        Blackboard users and will communicate it to you very soon to
        provide advanced notice. Again, we appreciate hearing from you
        when these difficulties arise and we appreciate your patience as
        we work to make the service more reliable.
      </p>
      
      <p>
