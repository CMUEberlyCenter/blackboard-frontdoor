  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <p>
    Once enrolled in a course, students are given access to the Blackboard
    course data. Students can interact with configured course tools, manage
    assignment submissions, and view grades.
  </p>

  <h2 id="gettingstarted/access">Access a Blackboard Course</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Open a browser and navigate to the Blackboard home page at
      <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/blackboard">http://www.cmu.edu/blackboard</a>.
      <br/>
      <img src="images/gettingstarted/login.png"
	   alt="Blackboard Login Button Screenshot" />
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click the &quot;Login&quot; button below the wordmark.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Authenticate using the Carnegie&nbsp;Mellon single sign-on system with
      an Andrew ID and password.
    </li>

    <li>
      When redirected to the Blackboard application, select a course to manage
      from the &quot;My Courses&quot; panel.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> If a course is missing from the &quot;My Courses&quot;
    panel, contact the instructor directly to resolve the problem.
  </p>

  <h2 id="gettingstarted/navigate">Course Navigation</h2>

  <p>
    The &quot;Course Menu&quot; is configured for each Blackboard course to
    reflect the tools and content to which students should have access. All
    course tools, assignments, and assessments should be available through the
    course menu.
  </p>

  <h2 id="gettingstarted/communicate">Communication Tools</h2>
   
  <p>
    Students can use the set of communication tools provided within the
    &quot;Tools&quot; area to contact each other or the instructor
    via email, participate in a discussion board forum, view student pages
    found in the class roster, and work in groups.
  </p>

  <h3>Send Email</h3>
  
  <p>
    The &quot;Send Email&quot utility sends email to the instructor and
    other enrolled students from within the Blackboard application. It lacks
    many features of dedicated email clients, including:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Saving sent messages</li>
    <li>Performing spell check</li>
    <li>Providing a &quot;CC:&quot; list of recipients</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Discussion Boards</h3>

  <p>
    Use a discussion board to participate in course-related
    discussion outside of class. Conversations are logged and organized by
    forums set by the instructor that contain threads of all related replies.
    The instructor may also choose to provide a forum where students are able
    to post anonymously.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Discussion boards have limited search capability. Select
    a meaningful subject line to facilitate notice and response.
  </p>

  <h3>Course Roster</h3>
  
  <p>
    Retrieve a list of users enrolled in the course. Based on an enrolled
    user's privacy configuration, their contact information can be retrieved
    from the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/directory">Carnegie&nbsp;Mellon
      Directory.</a>
  </p>
  
  <h3>Group Pages</h3>

  <p>
    Students enrolled in a course can be divided into project or study groups,
    and the instructor can provision the group with tools (e.g. blogs,
    calendars, discussion boards, tasks) accessible via the &quot;Groups&quot;
    tool.
  </p>

  <h2 id="gettingstarted/assignments">View &amp; Submit Assignments</h2>
  
  <p>
    The default location for assignments is a link named 
    &quot;Assignments&quot; under the &quot;Course Menu&quot;. The instructor
    will need to communicate the new location if that link is renamed or
    moved. Students will use this link to view assignment instructions, 
    download files provided by the instructor, and submit the completed
    assignment to the instructor.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Select an assignment under the assignments area to view instructions and
      download any assignment files provided by the instructor.
    </li>

    <li>
      Enter and/or upload assignment materials.
    </li>

    <li>
      When prepared to submit work for grading, click &quot;Submit&quot;<br/>
      <em>&mdash; or &mdash;</em><br/>
      To save for future submission, click &quot;Save as Draft&quot;
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> The instructor will not have access to the completed
    assignment until the user clicks &quot;Submit&quot;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Warning:</em> Remove any special characters from the filename and 
    add/confirm an appropriate file extension suffix before uploading the file
    to Blackboard or the grader may not be able to open it.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="gettingstarted/turnitin_assignments">Submit Turnitin Assignments</h2>
  
  <p>
    Instructors use the Turnitin service to detect plagiarism. Assignment
    submission is integrated into Blackboard and similar to a default
    Blackboard assignment submission.
  </p>

  <p class="eye_dagger">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Do not include personally identifiable information
    like a name in an assignment submitted through Turnitin. The service
    retains all submissions externally, and students need not sacrifice their
    FERPA-awarded rights to submit assignments. Instructors and other
    course staff will have a mapping of student to assignment submissions.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Locate the assignment within the course content or assignment pages
      as discussed in the <a href="#gettingstarted/assignments">View &amp;
	Submit Assignments directions</a> above.
    </li>

    <li>
      Click &quot;View/Complete&quot; below the assignment.<br/>

    </li>

    <li>

      next to the assignment to be handed in.<br/>

    </li>
    
    <li>

      assignment.<br/>

	   alt="Student Assignment List Screenshot" />
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="gettingstarted/grades">Check Grades</h2>

  <p>
    When the instructor manages grades within Blackboard and permits student
    access, grades are available for review within the &quot;My Grades&quot;
    utility under the &quot;Tools&quot; area.
  </p>

  <p>
    &quot;My Grades&quot; includes grade data like the grade item name, item
    details, due date, last submitted, grade value, points possible, and any
    instructor comments.
