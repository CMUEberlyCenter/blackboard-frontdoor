  <h1>Assignments</h1>

  <p>
    Instructors can add an assignment to receive student work within 
    Blackboard. Assignment creation triggers a new column creation
    in the &quot;Grade Center&quot; spreadsheet and allows all assignment
    submissions to be downloaded at once.

    <em>Warning:</em> Students will not see the assignment if it is not made
    available to them. There are several options for selecting when and for
    how long an assignment is available to students; the due dates may also
    be restricted.

      that have not yet been graded. <em>Note:</em> Other views are
      available in the &quot;Grade Center&quot;, e.g.: To see only assignment
      submissions, select &quot;Assignments&quot; under &quot;Full Grade
      Center&quot;.<br/>

  </ol>

  <h2 id="assignments/download">Download Assignment for Grading Offline</h2>

  <p>
    Instructors can download all student assignment submissions or can select
    individual student submissions to download:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      From the Grade Center spreadsheet, click the down arrows in the heading
      of the assignment column you wish to download. Select &quot;Assignment
      File Download&quot; from the dropdown menu.<br/>
      
      <img src="images/evaluate/assignment-download.jpg"
	   alt="Assignment Download Screenshot" />
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Use the top checkbox next to the &quot;Name&quot; column to select all
      student submissions (clicking the top checkbox selects all checkboxes
      below it) or select the checkbox next to individual student submissions
      for a more selective download.<br/>

	   alt="Assignment Download Selection Screenshot" />
    </li>

    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit&quot;.
    </li>

    <li>
      The system creates a compressed file in .zip format containing the
      assignment files. Click &quot;Download assignments now...&quot; and
      save the file to the local machine. Once the download is complete, 
      use a standard system utility to decompress the file; this procedure
      is OS specific, but typically entails double clicking the downloaded
      file on the desktop or a file manager.<br/>
