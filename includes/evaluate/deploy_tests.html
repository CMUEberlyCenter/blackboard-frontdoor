  <h1>Administer Tests &amp; Surveys</h1>

  <p>
    An existing test must be deployed as course content and made available
    to students before it can be taken by users.
  </p>

  <h2 id="deploy_tests/deploy">Deploy a Test</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Navigate to a content area within your course, then click 
      &quot;Item&quot; from the &quot;Build Content&quot; menu.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click &quot;Create&quot; to make a new test and then follow the
      <a href="evaluate#manage_tests/create">directions to make a new test</a>
      or select from the menu of previously created tests.
    </li>

    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit&quot; to enter the &quot;Test Options&quot;.
    </li>

    <li>
      &quot;Test Options&quot; controls the test availability and test-taking
      options for users.<br/>
      <em>Note:</em> If a test isn't explicitly made available, it will not
      be visible to student users.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="deploy_tests/make_available">Make a Test Available</h2>

  <p>
    A test can be deployed without being immediately available to users.
    To make it available after deployment:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      In the content area where the test is deployed, click the context menu
      and select &quot;Edit&quot; to enter the &quot;Edit Test Options&quot;
      page.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      On the &quot;Edit Test Options&quot; page, scroll to section 2, 
      &quot;Test Availability&quot;. Click &quot;Yes&quot; next to 
      &quot;Make the Link Available&quot;.
    </li>

    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit&quot; to immediately make the content area visible to
      student users.<br/>
      <em>Note:</em> If the instructor restricts the dates for when the test
      may be taken, students will not be able to begin taking the test until that designated date and time. 
  </ol>
