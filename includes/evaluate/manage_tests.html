  <h1>Manage Tests &amp; Surveys</h1>

  <p>
    From the &quot;Tests&quot; page in Blackboard, instructors will find the
    functionality for building and importing new tests, as well as a way to
    add questions to, edit, deploy and make available to students, and delete
    tests already created.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Surveys are created much the same way tests are created.
    Use the &quot;Surveys&quot; page instead of the &quot;Test&quot; page and
    click to &quot;Build Survey&quot; or &quot;Import Survey&quot; and follow
    a similar process as creating a test. The main difference between Tests
    and Surveys is that Surveys are anonymous. A green checkmark will appear
    in the Grade Center spreadsheet to indicate when a student has submitted
    a survey, however no student data is associated with student responses.
  </p>

  <h2 id="manage_tests/create">Create a New Test</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      From the &quot;Control Panel&quot;, expand &quot;Course Tools&quot;
      and click on &quot;Tests, Surveys, and Pools&quot;.
    </li>

    <li>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      Populate the test metadata, including the name, description, and
      instructions.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit&quot; to create the test and enter the &quot;Test
      Canvas&quot; page where questions are added.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="manage_tests/add">Add Questions to a Test</h3>

  <p>
    From the &quot;Test Canvas&quot; page, questions can be added to a test
    by creating new questions in Blackboard, selecting from previously created
    test questions or questions pools, or uploading questions from the local
    machine.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Select from a List of Question Types</h3>
  
  <p>
    To select from a list of question types, expand the &quot;Create
    Question&quot; dropdown menu and select from the various question types.
  </p>

  <h3>Create a Random Block of Questions/Find a Question from a Pool or
    Test</h3>
  
  <p>
    To create a random block of questions or to find a question from a pool or
    test previously created, expand the &quot;Reuse Question&quot; dropdown
    menu and select the desired option.
  </p>

  <h3>Upload Questions Prepared Offline</h3>

  <p>
    To upload questions prepared offline, click the &quot;Upload
    Questions&quot; menu item and select the prepared file from the local
    machine.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Questions will appear as part of the upload process. If
    a question in the file has an error, only that question will fail to
    upload. Questions from a file can be modified after the upload like
    ones created directly within Blackboard.
  </p>

  <h2 id="manage_tests/import_questions">Create Test Questions Offline</h2>

  <p>
    Tests can be created offline in a spreadsheet application, exported
    as a comma-separated or tab-delimited file, and imported to Blackboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Microsoft Excel is the spreadsheet application used in
    the instructions below, but any properly formated text file can be 
    imported.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      In a new spreadsheet, enter the question information into rows and
      columns. Each row will represent a question.
      <ul>
