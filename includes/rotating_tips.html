  <h1>Eberly Workshop &mdash;<br/>
    Collaboration:  A focus on process, not just product</h1>
  <p><strong>Wednesday, October 10, 10:30am-Noon, A70 Cyert Hall</strong></p>

  <p>
    Many faculty want to include collaborative learning in their
    courses but encounter many questions along the way: How will I
    keep students “on task”? Does it matter how students are paired?
    In this session, CMU Prof. Carolyn Rose will join us in discussing
    various ways to promote more effective collaboration and, in turn,
    better learning (especially in STEM topics).
  </p>

  <h1>Important News! &mdash;<br/>
    LMS Evaluation coming to a close</h1>
  <p>
  Throughout 2016, we have been conducting an evaluation of Blackboard while piloting Canvas, a competing Learning Management System (LMS). This evaluation was first announced in December 2015.<br/>
  We have been collecting and analyzing data on system functionality, tool usage, user experience, and more. Now, we are coming to the final stage of this evaluation process and will be making a decision in December regarding which system will be our university-supported LMS.<br><br>
  You can review what we have done to date by visiting the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/technology/LMSevaluation/index.html">LMS evaluation web page.
