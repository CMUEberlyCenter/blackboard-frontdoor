      <h3>Saturday, Feb. 16, 12:00-1:45am</h3>
      Due to recent issues with some of Computing Services' back-end
      systems that have been causing Blackboard to fail and become
      unavailable at times during the last two weekends, we are
      scheduling a necessary system maintenance window
      from <strong>12:00am (Midnight) until 1:00am on February 16
      (early Saturday)</strong>. Blackboard will be UNAVAILABLE during
      this 1-hour window. We apologize for any inconvenience you may
      experience as a result of this necessary outage.

      <h3>Tuesday, Feb. 5: 11:20pm-12:30am</h3>
      <em>N.B.: 40 minutes of emergency downtime predated the
	maintenance window.</em><br/><br/>  A necessary system outage
	has been put in place from <strong>12:00am Midnight until
	3:00am on Tuesday, February 5, 2013</strong> to resolve issues
	related to the unexpected service outage that occurred this
	past weekend. Because of broader issues affecting a set of
	central computing systems, some that the Blackboard service
	relies upon, the Blackboard system was unexpectedly
	unavailable on Sunday, Feb 3. Though we were able to bring the
	system back up, we have found additional critical system work
	that is now needed.<br/><br/>
    
      We apologize for any inconvenience you may experience as a result
      of this unexpected downtime and thank you for your patience.
