      <h3>Saturday, Mar. 2, 12:30-1:37am</h3>
      <strong>Interim solution to fix system issues affecting
	Blackboard</strong> <br/><br/>

      Due to recent issues with Computing Services' back-end systems
      (i.e., Storage Area Network technology failures) that have been
      causing Blackboard to go down, we are scheduling a necessary
      downtime window to put into place an interim solution that
      should improve system performance this semester.<br/><br/>

      This outage will occur from <strong>12:30am-5:00am on March
	2</strong> (just after Midnight on Saturday morning).<br/><br/>

      We apologize for the recent series of Blackboard outages and for
      any disruption to your academic work this may have caused. The
      stability and security of the Blackboard service is a number one
      priority for us and we are working to remediate the
      situation.<br/>

      experienced an UNEXPECTED Blackboard service outage
      on <em>Saturday, February 23, 2013 from approximately 9am until
	12:30pm</em> due to several back-end technical issues. We were
      actively working to resolve the problem during this time. The
      issues have been resolved and we will continue to monitor the
      service closely.<br /><br />  We apologize for any inconvenience
      you may have experienced due to this unexpected downtime and thank
      you for your patience.

      <h3>Saturday, Feb. 16, 12:00-1:45am</h3>
      Due to recent issues with some of Computing Services' back-end
      systems that have been causing Blackboard to fail and become
      unavailable at times during the last two weekends, we are
      scheduling a necessary system maintenance window
      from <strong>12:00am (Midnight) until 1:00am on February 16
      (early Saturday)</strong>. Blackboard will be UNAVAILABLE during
      this 1-hour window. We apologize for any inconvenience you may
      experience as a result of this necessary outage.

      <h3>Tuesday, Feb. 5: 11:20pm-12:30am</h3>
      <em>N.B.: 40 minutes of emergency downtime predated the
	maintenance window.</em><br/><br/>  A necessary system outage
	has been put in place from <strong>12:00am Midnight until
	3:00am on Tuesday, February 5, 2013</strong> to resolve issues
	related to the unexpected service outage that occurred this
	past weekend. Because of broader issues affecting a set of
	central computing systems, some that the Blackboard service
	relies upon, the Blackboard system was unexpectedly
	unavailable on Sunday, Feb 3. Though we were able to bring the
	system back up, we have found additional critical system work
	that is now needed.<br/><br/>
    
      We apologize for any inconvenience you may experience as a result
      of this unexpected downtime and thank you for your patience.
