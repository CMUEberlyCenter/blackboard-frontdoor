    <strong>Interim solution to fix system issues affecting
      Blackboard</strong> <br/><br/>

    Due to recent issues with Computing Services' back-end systems
    (i.e., Storage Area Network technology failures) that have been
    causing Blackboard to go down, we are scheduling a necessary
    downtime window to put into place an interim solution that should
    improve system performance this semester.<br/><br/>

    This outage will occur from <strong>12:30am-5:00am on March
    2</strong> (just after Midnight on Saturday morning).<br/><br/>

    We apologize for the recent series of Blackboard outages and for
    any disruption to your academic work this may have caused. The
    stability and security of the Blackboard service is a number one
    priority for us and we are working to remediate the
    situation.<br/>
