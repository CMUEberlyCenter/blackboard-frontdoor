    <strong>Collaboration: A focus on process, not just
    product</strong><br/>
    <strong>Wednesday, October 10, 10:30am-Noon</strong><br/>
    Many faculty want to include collaborative learning in their
    courses but encounter many questions along the way: How will I
    keep students “on task”? Does it matter how students are paired?
    In this session, CMU Prof. Carolyn Rose will join us in discussing
    various ways to promote more effective collaboration and, in turn,
    better learning (especially in STEM topics).<br/><br/>
