  <h1>Blackboard Downtime Alert!</h1>
  <p>
    Due to recent issues with some of Computing Services' back-end
    systems that have been causing Blackboard to fail and become
    unavailable at times during the last two weekends, we are
    scheduling a necessary system maintenance window
    from <strong>12:00am (Midnight) until 1:00am on February 16 (early
    Saturday)</strong>. Blackboard will be UNAVAILABLE during this
    1-hour window. We apologize for any inconvenience you may
    experience as a result of this necessary outage.
