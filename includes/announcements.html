  <h1>Blackboard System Update!</h1>
  
  <p style="font-size:14px; line-height:18px;">
    Recently, we installed system updates necessary for maintaining
    the stability and security of the system. If you would like help
    with your Blackboard course, please
    contact <strong>bb-help@andrew.cmu.edu</strong>.<br />
  </p>

  <div style="padding:18px 80px 25px 50px; font-size: 14px; line-height:18px;">
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> When you first login, you will notice an
    initial screen, imposed by Blackboard, Inc., that allows you to
    review a few of the settings. Once you hit the &quot;Close&quot;
    link provided, this screen will not reappear.<br />  &nbsp;<br />

  <strong>Instructors:</strong>
  As part of the system updates, Blackboard, Inc. has included an
  enhancement to the interface visual design. We want to make you
  aware that the changes in the user interface are almost entirely
  visual/skin. The position of your menus and content areas remains
  the same. The functionality is also the same. Within the content
  areas, however, the arrows for selecting functional menus will be
  visible only upon rollover.<br />&nbsp;<br />
