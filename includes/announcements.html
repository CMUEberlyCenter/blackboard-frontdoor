  <h1>Important News! LMS evaluation coming to a close</h1>
  <p>
    Throughout 2016, we have been conducting an evaluation of Blackboard while piloting Canvas, a competing Learning Management System (LMS). This evaluation was first announced in December 2015.<br/><br/>
    We have been collecting and analyzing data on system functionality, tool usage, user experience, and more. Now, we are coming to the final stage of this evaluation process and will be making a decision in December regarding which system will be our university-supported LMS.<br><br>
	You can review what we have done to date by visiting the <ul><a href="http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/technology/LMSevaluation/index.html">LMS evaluation web page.</a></ul><br><br>
	And if you have additional questions about the LMS evaluation, please feel free to email us at: <a href="mailto: bb-help@andrew.cmu.edu">bb-help@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.
