    <strong>Blackboard services have been restored.</strong> We
    experienced an UNEXPECTED Blackboard service outage on <em>Sunday,
    February 3, 2013 from approximately 10:10am until 4:40pm</em> due

    resolve the problem during this time. The issues have been
    resolved and we will continue to monitor the service
    closely.<br /><br />

    We apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced due to
