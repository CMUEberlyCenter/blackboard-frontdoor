  <h1>Blackboard Downtime Alert!</h1>
  <p>
    Due to recent and recurring issues with Computing Services'
    back-end systems that have been causing Blackboard to fail and
    become unavailable in recent months, we are scheduling a necessary
    system maintenance window from <strong>12:30am until 5am on March 3
      (just after Midnight on Saturday morning)</strong>. Blackboard will be
    UNAVAILABLE during this 3.5-hour window.<br/><br/>
    
    PLEASE NOTE: The stability and security of the Blackboard service
    is a number one priority for us. We realize that the recent
    recurrent outages have impacted you and we are working tirelessly
    to remediate the situation. We will inform you of these efforts in
    an upcoming announcement.<br/><br/>
    
    We apologize for any inconvenience you may experience as a result
    of this necessary system outage.
