  <h1>Resolved Bugs &amp; Issues</h1>

  <p>
    These are bugs &amp; issues that are pending with Blackboard, Inc., do not
    have a reasonable workaround, or are otherwise unresolved.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="resolved_bugs/users_error_message">Instructors receive an error message 
    after clicking &quot;Users&quot; from within the &quot;Control Panel&quot;
  </h2>

  <h3>Date Reported</h3>

  <p>
    January 4, 2012
  </p>

  <h3>Problem Description</h3>
  
  <p>
    Any course that has disabled user accounts (which occur when a student
    officially drops a course) causes this error message which makes it
    impossible to view or manage users.
  </p>

  <h3>Resolution Status</h3>

  <p>

  <h2 id="resolved_bugs/cant_download_pdf">I cannot download and view a PDF</h2>

  <h3>Date Reported</h3>

  <p>
    August 2011
  </p>

  <h3>Problem Description</h3>

  <p>
    Users cannot display and/or download a PDF. When the PDF link is clicked, 
    an empty window or a download plugin message appears. This is because PDFs
    that were uploaded using the &quot;File&quot; content type in Blackboard
    are not compatible with all browsers and versions and there is no one
    solution that will work for all browser types and for some browser 
    versions there is no solution to the problem.
  </p>

  <h3>Resolution Status</h3>
  
  <p>
    Resolved

  <h2 id="resolved_bugs/cant_submit_test">Student cannot Submit a Test/Assessment</h2>

  <h3>Date Reported</h3>

  <p>
    June 2011
  </p>

  <h3>Problem Description</h3>

  <p>
    Students taking a test will submit their answers and receive an error
    message directing them to refresh their screen. After refreshing, 
    Blackboard will prompt the user to access the exam and submit again. 
    Upon attempting this second submit, a message will appear explaining that
    the user no longer has access to the exam as it has already been
    completed.
  </p>

  <h3>Resolution Status</h3>

  <p>
    Resolved
  </p>
    
  <h3>Workaround</h3>

  <p>
    Students should save each answer as they go. When students have saved
    their answers, instructors can go into the Grade Center, view the 
    attempts, and submit on behalf of the students. If there is not any work
    there (likely because students were not saving after each answer) it is
    necessary for instructors to clear the original attempt and students will
    need to take the test/assessment again.
  </p>

  <h2 id="resolved_bugs/browser_timeout">Lost Work Because the Browser Times Out</h2>

  <h3>Date Reported</h3>

  <p>
    June 2011
  </p>

  <h3>Problem Description</h3>

  <p>
    Instructors working in Blackboard for an extended period of time get
    logged out or receive an error message causing them to lose work. A 
    generic Blackboard error message appears (e.g. &quot;multipart/form-data
    not allowed&quot;).
  </p>

  <h3>Resolution Status</h3>
  
  <p>
    Resolved
  </p>

  <h3>Workaround</h3>

  <p>
    Consider saving work often and when performing tasks that are time
    consuming (as when using the Grade Center), save frquently, and then
    refresh the browser window.
