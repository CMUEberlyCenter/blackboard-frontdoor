  <h2 id="active_bugs/lost_formatting">Formatting is lost and attempts to fix won't
    work</h2>

  <h3>Date Reported</h3>

  <p>
    June 2011
  </p>
  
  <h3>Problem Description</h3>

  <p>
    Anytime previous content is copied into a new Blackboard course
    (regardless of which Blackboard version) some formatting can be lost. 
    This is happening with Blackboard 9.1, but we are also finding that users
    attempting to make additional formatting edits may lose their changes when
    submitting.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Resolution Status</h3>

  <p>
    Reported to Blackboard, Inc. This problem is related to the html editor
    in Blackboard and how Blackboard handles html in general.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Workaround</h3>
  
  <p>
    <em>Option 1</em> &mdash; Copy content from its original formatted text
    source file (e.g. Word doc) and paste it into a plain text format
    (e.g. using TextEdit or Note Pad), then copy and paste the plain text 
    into Blackboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Option 2</em> &mdash; Try a different browser.
  </p>
