  <h1>Export/Archive a Course</h1>

  <p>
    Instructors can choose to save a copy of your course by using the 
    Export/Archive function in Blackboard.
  </p>

  <h2 id="export/lifecycle">Course Lifecycle</h2>
  
  <p>
    The Office of Technology for Education maintains a copy of all courses on
    the Blackboard server. Instructors of record for each Blackboard course 
    continue to have access. However access to students is removed two weeks
    into the following semester after the course was taught.
