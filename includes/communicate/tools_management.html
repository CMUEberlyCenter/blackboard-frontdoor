    <h1>&quot;Edit Mode&quot;</h1>

    <p>
      Instructors must turn &quot;Edit Mode&quot; on to expose the action
      menus that enable editing and adding content to pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The &quot;Edit Mode&quot; button is in the upper right of a course
      content page. Click on the button to turn it on or off.

  <h1>Tools Management</h1>
  
  <p>
    Instructors have a variety of collaboration tools, including a few new
    tools like blogs, wikis, and journals, to choose from and to make 
    available for students to use in a Blackboard course.
  </p>

  <h2 id="tools_management/create_links">Create Links to the Tools</h2>
  
  <p>
    In this version of Blackboard, instructors can now place tools on course 
    page within the context of related course materials and enter a 
    meaningful name for a tool (e.g. instead of using a generic label like 
    &quot;Discussion Board,&quot; you can enter a name for the tool that 
    indicates the topic of the discussion). Instructors can also easily link to
    a collaboration tool (e.g. a wiki) or set of tools from the course menu and
    again edit the name to provide a meaningful label.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The &quot;Tools&quot; page is still provided, and if you wish to use that
    as the entry point to the tool set you wish your students to use,
    instructors will need to make sure that a  link to that page is available
    to students.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Add a Collaboration Tool to a Course Page</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      From a content area in the course and with &quot;Edit Mode&quot; turned
      ON, mouse over the &quot;Add Interactive Tool&quot; button located at
      the top of the page to expand the tool selections.<br/>
      <img src="images/communicate/add-interactive-tool.png"
	   alt="Add Interactive Tool Screenshot" />
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Select from the dropdown menu, the collaborative tool you want to link
      to from the content area you are currently working in:
      <ul >
	<li>Discussion Board</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
	<li>Journal</li>
	<li>Wiki</li>
	<li>Groups</li>
	<li>Chat</li>
	<li>Virtual Classroom</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Rearrange where the link to the tool is placed on the page or see the
      <a href="build#rearrange">documentation</a> on how to rearrange items
      on a page.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Add a Tool to the Course Menu</h3>
  
  <p>
    Click the plus (+) button in the course menu and select &quot;Create Tool 
    Link.&quot; Enter a name for the link and choose the tool from the list.
    Then optionally click the checkbox to make it available to users. Once you
    make it available, students will have access to the link. If you do not 
    make it available, only users with the role of instructor and TA will have
    access to the link.<br/>

  </p>
  
  <h3>Add Access to the Tools Area</h3>
  
  <p>
    The Tools Area is still available for your use. If you want students to
    access this area, you will need to make sure you have provided a link to
    it. Click the (+) sign in the course menu to add a link to the Tools Area 
    from the course menu.<br/>

    <img src="images/communicate/add-tool-link-tool-area.png"
	 alt="Add Tool Link to Tools Area Screenshot" />
  </p>

  <p>
    Within the Tools Area, individual tools can be disabled by clicking the
    &quot;Hide Link&quot; button next to the particular tool.<br/>

  <h2 id="tools_management/make_available">Make Tools Available</h2>

  <p>
    Instructors have the ability to determine which course tools are available
    to students. You can either leave the default settings and provide access
    to all, or use a limited set of tools and create links to those. If you
    want students to access the tools, make sure a link to the tools is 
    available for them.
  </p>

  <div>
    <img src="images/communicate/make-tools-available.png"
	 alt="Tool Availability Screenshot" />
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Expand the Control Panel and click &quot;Tool Availability&quot; under
    the &quot;Customization&quot; menu. The list of all tools will appear and
    you can select to make them available or unavailable to students. Some 
    commonly used tools include:
    <ul>
      <li>Discussion Board</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Groups</li>
      <li>My Grades</li>
    </ul>
