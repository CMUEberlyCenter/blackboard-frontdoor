  <h1>Set Up Groups</h1>

  <p>
    Instructors are able to set up groups in Blackboard to support 
    collaboration. Depending on your preferences, users can be enrolled in 
    groups manually, randomly, or through self-enrollment.
  </p>

  <h2 id="set_up_groups/create">Create a Group</h2>

  <p> 
    Instructors can create Group pages for a single group or for a group set
    and can then link to group pages from within course content pages. From a 
    content area in the course, click on the &quot;Add Interactive Tool&quot; 
    button and select &quot;Groups.&quot; (Alternatively, you can follow a 
    similar creation process by navigating to the &quot;Control Panel, 
    selecting &quot;Users and Groups,&quot; and then selecting
    &quot;Groups.&quot;)
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Click on the &quot;Create Single Group button or &quot;Create Group
      Set&quot;, and select either &quot;Self-Enroll&quot; or &quot;Manual
      Enroll&quot;.
      <ul>
        <li>
	  <em>Self-Enroll</em> allows students to join the Group themselves 
	  by adding their name to a sign-up sheet. Sign-up sheets can be made 
	  available on the Groups page, and can limit the number of people 
	  allowed to join the Group. Self-Enrollment Groups can be made one 
	  at a time, or made in sets.
        </li>
        
	<li>
	  <em>Manual Enroll</em> allows the instructor to assign students 
	  to groups.
        </li>
        
	<li>
	  <em>Random Enroll</em> distributes students into Groups randomly
	  and based on the desired number of students per group, or the 
	  desired number of Groups. For example, if there are 24 students 
	  enrolled in a Course, and the Instructor wants four students per 
	  group, the system would create six Groups. If the Instructor wanted
	  four groups, the system would randomly enroll six students per Group.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Choose to make the group unavailable, available or sign-up sheet only.
      <ul>
        <li>
	  Instructors may click &quot;No&quot; for the group to be unavailable
	  in case the instructor needs to finish with the options before the
	  students can see it.
	</li>
        
	<li>
	  Clicking &quot;Yes&quot; will put up a sign-up sheet and students
	  will be enrolled when they sign up.
	</li>
	
        <li>
	  Selecting &quot;Sign-up Sheet Only&quot; will create a sign-up sheet
	  and the instructor will need to approve the groups before the
	  students are actually enrolled.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit&quot; to create group.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2 id="set_up_groups/edit_or_delete">Edit or Delete a Group</h2>

  <p>
    Click on the down arrows next to the name of a group and then click on 
    &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Delete.&quot;
  </p>

  <h2 id="set_up_groups/view_group_pages">View Group Pages</h2>
  
  <p>
    Once groups are created for users in a course, instructors can access the 
    group pages for every group in the course and students can access the group
    pages for the groups they are in.
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Go to the Control Panel, Users and Groups, and then select Groups.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click on the Group Name to view the group page. Instructors are able to
      add course modules, add group modules, email group members, edit group 
      tools and assignments.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2 id="set_up_groups/add_course_modules">Add Course Modules</h2>
  
  <p>
    Click on the &quot;Add Course Module&quot; button. Select the modules to
    appear on the group page, and click &quot;Submit&quot;.
