  <h1>User Enrollment in a Blackboard Course</h1>

  <p>
    Enrollment in a Blackboard course will typically occur automatically
    based on registration, but users may also be added manually.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/automatic">
    Automatic Enrollment for Instructors and Registered Students
  </h2>

  <p>
    Students registered in the HUB and officially enrolled in a course will
    automatically be enrolled in a Blackboard course. Based on the Blackboard
    course request made by the instructor, the instructor and TAs listed on
    the request form will also be automatically enrolled in the Blackboard
    course (given the instructor has requested a Blackboard course).
  </p>

  <p class="eye_dagger">
    <strong>Common Problem:</strong><br/>
    Certain types of students commonly experience enrollment
    problems and therefore do not have access to course materials in
    Blackboard, <em>especially during the first two weeks of the semester</em>.
    <br/><br/>

    <strong>Cross-Registered Students:</strong> It can take up to two weeks
    for cross-registered students to receive their Andrew IDs. While students
    await their Andrew IDs, instructors may wish to
    <a href="../manage#guests">allow guest access</a> to their Blackboard course.
    <br/><br/>

    <strong>Students on the Wait List:</strong> Wait-listed students do not
    initially have access to the Blackboard course site. If you have important
    course materials that students need to see before they become automatically
    enrolled in the Blackboard course, you may want to manually enroll these 
    students.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/manual">Enroll a TA / User</h2>

  <p>
    Instructors have the ability to <strong>manually</strong> enroll users
    in the course (e.g. TAs, students, guest lecturers). TAs can enroll students and
    guests in a course, but cannot enroll other TAs or instructors.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Users must have an Andrew account to be added to the 
    course. If a user does not have an Andrew account, refer to the 
    <a href="../manage#accounts">&quot;User Accounts&quot; documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      From the &quot;Control Panel&quot;, expand the &quot;Users and
      Groups&quot; menu.
    </li>

    <li>
      Click &quot;Users&quot;.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click &quot;Find Users to Enroll&quot; (located at the top of the

      <img src="../images/manage/find-users-to-enroll.png"
	   alt="Find Users to Enroll Screenshot" />
    </li>

    <li>
      If the Andrew ID of the user to add to the course is known, it can be supplied
      directly in the &quot;Username&quot; text field. If the Andrew ID of the user is
      not known, search for the user:
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Click &quot;Browse...&quot; to bring up a search window.<br/>
	  <img src="../images/manage/search-users-browse.png"
	       alt="Search Users - Browse Screenshot" />
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  Select the appropriate field to search against:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Username: The user's Andrew ID<br/>
	      (the text before the <strong>@andrew.cmu.edu</strong> in
	      an official email address)<br/>
	      <strong>Note:</strong> The text before an <strong>@cmu.edu</strong> email
	      address is <strong>not</strong> guaranteed to be an andrew id.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      Last Name: The user's surname
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      First Name: The user's given name
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>
	      Email: The user's email address. 
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  <img src="../images/manage/search-field.png"
	       alt="Select Search Field Screenshot" />
	</li>

	<li>
	  Select the search type &quot;Contains&quot; from the second dropdown menu, as
	  it is the most liberal. Leave it as this unless too many results are
	  returned to read through.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Enter the known information about the user in text box.<br/>
	  <img src="../images/manage/search-users-text.png"
	       alt="Search Text Screenshot" />
	</li>

	<li>
	  Click &quot;Go&quot;. Blackboard will return a list of users that matches
	  the search parameters.<br/>
	  <strong>Be Aware:</strong> A user already enrolled in the course will not be
	  returned in these search results.<br/>
	  <strong>Note:</strong> When a student has become &quot;disabled&quot; in the
	  course, his/her name will not appear in either list. Contact
	  Blackboard Support for assistance when this occurs.

	</li>
	
	<li>
	  Select the checkbox next to each user that should be enrolled in the
	  course.<br/>
	  <img src="../images/manage/search-users-results-checked.png"
	       alt="Search Users Results Checked Screenshot" />
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  Click &quot;Submit&quot; to return to the &quot;Enroll Users&quot;
	  page with the results of the search. The username text field will
	  be populated with the users returned from the search.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      From the &quot;Enrollment Availability&quot; dropdown menu, select a role for
      the user or leave the default (&quot;Student&quot;).<br/>
      <img src="../images/manage/enroll-users-student.png"
	   alt="Enroll Users - Student Screenshot" />
    </li>

    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit&quot; to enroll the user.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> In Blackboard 9.1, the &quot;Search&quot; field on the
    &quot;Users&quot; page is intended for searching students already enrolled
    in the Blackboard course and does NOT search for all users listed in the
    Carnegie&nbsp;Mellon directory. A separate &quot;Search&quot; field is
    provided for finding users to manually enroll in the course.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/list">List Enrolled Users</h2>
  
  <p>
    Expand the &quot;Users and Groups&quot; area in the &quot;Control
    Panel&quot; and click on &quot;Users&quot;. A list of users enrolled in 
    the course will appear.<br/>
    <img src="../images/manage/list-users.png"
	 alt="List Users Screenshot" />
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> If all users are not showing and you'd like to show all, 
    click the &quot;Show All&quot; button located beneath the list of users.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the list of students is empty, Blackboard may have a cached filter. To
    reset the filter and view all enrolled users:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Locate the two dropdown menus that appear under the &quot;Find Users to
      Enroll&quot; button at the top of the &quot;Users&quot; page.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Select &quot;Not blank&quot; in the second dropdown menu.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Delete any text that appears in the text box to its right.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click &quot;Go&quot; which appears to the far right of the text box.
      This will prompt Blackboard to load the current list of enrolled users.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2 id="enrollment/search">Search for an Enrolled User</h2>

  <p>
    Enter an enrolled user's Last Name, User Name, or Email address in the 
    Search field and click the &quot;Go&quot; button. The user's 
    information (name, username, email, role in Blackboard) will appear.<br/>
    <img src="../images/manage/search-enrolled-users.png"

  </p>

  <p class="eye_dagger">
    <strong>Note:</strong> This search utility will only return results for users
    already enrolled in the course.
