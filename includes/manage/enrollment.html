  <h1>User Enrollment in a Blackboard Course</h1>

  <p>
    Enrollment in a Blackboard course will typically occur automatically
    based on registration, but users may also be added manually.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/automatic">
    Automatic Enrollment for Instructors and Registered Students
  </h2>

  <p>
    Students registered in the HUB and officially enrolled in a course will
    automatically be enrolled in a Blackboard course. Based on the Blackboard
    course request made by the instructor, the instructor and TAs listed on
    the request form will also be automatically enrolled in the Blackboard
    course.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Certain types of students commonly experience enrollment
    problems and therefore do not have access to course materials in
    Blackboard, <em>especially during the first two weeks of the semester</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Cross-Registered Students:</em> It can take up to two weeks for 
    cross-registered students to receive their Andrew IDs. While your 
    students await their Andrew IDs, you may want to allow guest access to 
    your Blackboard course.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Students on the Wait List:</em> Wait-listed students do not initially
    have access to the Blackboard course site. If you have important course
    materials that students need to see before they become automatically
    enrolled in the Blackboard course, you may want to manually enroll these 
    students.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/manual">Manually Enroll a User</h2>

  <p>
    Instructors and TAs have the ability to manually enroll a user in the 
    course (such as a TA, waitlisted student, guest lecturer).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Users must have an Andrew account to be added to the 
    course. If a user does not have an Andrew account, refer to the 
    <a href="manage#accounts">&quot;User Accounts&quot; documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      From the &quot;Control Panel,&quot; expand the &quot;Users and
      Groups&quot; menu, then click &quot;Users&quot;.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click the &quot;Find Users to Enroll&quot; button (located at the top of
      the &quot;Users&quot; page).
    </li>

    <li>
      You can either enter one or more &quot;Username(s)&quot; (separated by a
      comma) in the text field provided, or click &quot;Browse...&quot; to
      search for a user. When the search is complete a list of names will 
      appear.<br/>
      
      <em>Be aware:</em> If the user you are trying to add is already enrolled
      in the Blackboard course, his/her name will not appear in the search
      return list.<br/>
      
      <em>Note:</em> When a student has become &quot;disabled&quot; in the
      course, his/her name will not appear in either list. Contact Blackboard
      Support for assistance when this occurs.
    </li>

    <li>
      Select the checkbox next to the name(s) of the individual(s) you'd
      like to enroll.
    </li>

    <li>
      Select the role for the user or leave it at the default of 
      &quot;Student.&quot;
    </li>

    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit.&quot;
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> In Blackboard 9.1, the &quot;Search&quot; field on the
    &quot;Users&quot; page is intended for searching students already enrolled
    in the Blackboard course and does NOT search for all users listed in the
    Carnegie&nbsp;Mellon directory. A separate &quot;Search&quot; field is
    provided for finding users to manually enroll in the course.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/list">List Enrolled Users</h2>
  
  <p>
    Expand the &quot;Users and Groups&quot; area in the &quot;Control
    Panel&quot; and click on &quot;Users&quot;. A list of users enrolled in 
    the course will appear.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> If all users are not showing and you'd like to show all, 
    click the &quot;Show All&quot; button located beneath the list of users.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="enrollment/search">Search for an Enrolled User</h2>

  <p>
    Enter an enrolled user's Last Name, User Name, or Email address in the 
    Search field and click the &quot;Search&quot; button. The user's 
    information (name, username, email, role in Blackboard) will appear.
