  <h1>User Enrollment in a Blackboard Course</h1>

  <p>
    Enrollment in a Blackboard course will typically occur automatically
    based on registration, but users may also be added manually.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/automatic">
    Automatic Enrollment for Instructors and Registered Students
  </h2>

  <p>
    Students registered in the HUB and officially enrolled in a course will
    automatically be enrolled in a Blackboard course. Based on the Blackboard
    course request made by the instructor, the instructor and TAs listed on
    the request form will also be automatically enrolled in the Blackboard
    course.
  </p>

  <p class="eye_dagger">
    <strong>Common Problem:</strong><br/>
    Certain types of students commonly experience enrollment
    problems and therefore do not have access to course materials in
    Blackboard, <em>especially during the first two weeks of the semester</em>.
    <br/><br/>

    <strong>Cross-Registered Students:</strong> It can take up to two weeks
    for cross-registered students to receive their Andrew IDs. While students
    await their Andrew IDs, instructors may wish to
    <a href="manage#guests">allow guest access</a> to their Blackboard course.
    <br/><br/>

    <strong>Students on the Wait List:</strong> Wait-listed students do not
    initially have access to the Blackboard course site. If you have important
    course materials that students need to see before they become automatically
    enrolled in the Blackboard course, you may want to manually enroll these 
    students.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/manual">Enroll a TA / User</h2>

  <p>
    Instructors and TAs have the ability to <strong>manually</strong> enroll a
    user in the course (such as a TA, waitlisted student, guest lecturer).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Users must have an Andrew account to be added to the 
    course. If a user does not have an Andrew account, refer to the 
    <a href="manage#accounts">&quot;User Accounts&quot; documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      From the &quot;Control Panel&quot;, expand the &quot;Users and
      Groups&quot; menu, then click &quot;Users&quot;.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click &quot;Enroll User&quot; &gt; &quot;Find Users to Enroll&quot;
      (located at the top of the &quot;Users&quot; page).<br/>

    </li>

    <li>
      If the Andrew ID of the user is known, it can be supplied directly in the
      &quot;Username&quot; text field. Otherwise, search for the user:
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Click &quot;Browse...&quot; to bring up a search window.<br/>

	       style="height: 115px; width: 550px;" />
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  Select the appropriate field to search against:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Username: The user's Andrew ID<br/>
	      (the text before the <strong>@andrew.cmu.edu</strong> in
	      an official email address)<br/>
	      <em>Note:</em> The text before an <strong>@cmu.edu</strong> email
	      address is <strong>not</strong> guaranteed to be an andrew id.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      Last Name: The user's surname
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      First Name: The user's given name
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>
	      Email: The user's email address. 
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	       style="height: 115px; width: 550px;" />
	</li>

	<li>
	  The search type &quot;Contains&quot; is the most liberal. Leave
	  it as this unless too many results are returned to read through.
	</li>

	<li>
	  Enter the known information about the user in text box.<br/>
	  <img src="images/manage/search-users-text.png"
	       alt="Search Text Screenshot"
	       style="height: 70px; width: 550px;" />
	</li>

	<li>
	  Click &quot;Go&quot; to retrieve the search results.<br/>
	  <em>Note:</em> A user already enrolled in the course will not be
	  returned in these search results.<br/>
	  <em>Note:</em> When a student has become &quot;disabled&quot; in the
	  course, his/her name will not appear in either list. Contact
	  Blackboard Support for assistance when this occurs.

	</li>
	
	<li>
	  Click &quot;Submit&quot; to return to the &quot;Enroll Users&quot;
	  page with the results of the search. The username text field will
	  be populated with the users returned from the search.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Select a role for the user from the &quot;Role&quot; dropdown menu
      or leave the default (&quot;Student&quot;).<br/>

    </li>

    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit&quot; to enroll the user.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> In Blackboard 9.1, the &quot;Search&quot; field on the
    &quot;Users&quot; page is intended for searching students already enrolled
    in the Blackboard course and does NOT search for all users listed in the
    Carnegie&nbsp;Mellon directory. A separate &quot;Search&quot; field is
    provided for finding users to manually enroll in the course.
  </p>

  <h2 id="enrollment/list">List Enrolled Users</h2>
  
  <p>
    Expand the &quot;Users and Groups&quot; area in the &quot;Control
    Panel&quot; and click on &quot;Users&quot;. A list of users enrolled in 
    the course will appear.<br/>
    <img src="images/manage/list-users.png"
	 alt="List Users Screenshot" />
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> If all users are not showing and you'd like to show all, 
    click the &quot;Show All&quot; button located beneath the list of users.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="enrollment/search">Search for an Enrolled User</h2>

  <p>
    Enter an enrolled user's Last Name, User Name, or Email address in the 
    Search field and click the &quot;Search&quot; button. The user's 
    information (name, username, email, role in Blackboard) will appear.<br/>

  </p>

  <p class="eye_dagger">
    <em>Note:</em> This search utility will only return results for users
    already enrolled in the course.
