  <h1>Guest Access</h1>

  <p>
    Guests are defined by Blackboard, Inc. as users in a course who do not 
    directly participate in its activities. By default, Guest Access is turned
    off. Once the instructor turns on guest settings at various levels within
    the course, guests will have the ability to access the course and those
    areas and files within the course that the instructor has enabled.

    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="#guests/enable/downloads">

  <p><em>Warning:</em> You should not open access to guests if your Blackboard
    course contains copyrighted material.
