  <h1>Guest Access</h1>

  <p>
    Guests are defined by Blackboard, Inc. as users in a course who do not 
    directly participate in its activities. By default, Guest Access is turned
    off. Once the instructor turns on guest settings at various levels within
    the course, guests will have the ability to access the course and those
    areas and files within the course that the instructor has enabled.
  </p>

  <h2 id="guests/enroll">Enroll Guests</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Each guest must already have an Andrew account.

  </p>

  <p>
    Follow the process to <a href="#enrollment/manual">manually enroll a 
      user</a>. When able to select a role for the user, select 
    &quot;Guest&quot;.
  </p>

  <h2 id="guests/enable">Enable Guest Access</h2>

  <p>
    To successfully enable guest access, three different configuration
    changes must be made:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="#guests/enable/course">
	Turn on guest access at the course level.</a>

      <a href="#guests/enable/content">
	Make course areas visible to guests.</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <a href="#guests/enable/downloads">
	Provide guest access to download files.</a>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><em>Warning:</em> Instructors should not open access to guests if the
    Blackboard course contains copyrighted material.
