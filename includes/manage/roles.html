  <h1>User Roles &amp; Affordances</h1>

  <p>
    User roles govern the amount and type of access to components of a
    Blackboard Course.
  </p>

  <h2 id="roles/types">Types of User Roles</h2>

  <p>
    A user can be assigned only one of the following roles:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Instructor</em>
      has master access over the Blackboard course functions.
    </li>

    <li>
      <em>Teaching Assistant</em>
      has almost the same access level that the instructor does, with the 
      exception that a TA CANNOT add additional instructors and TAs to a
      Blackboard course. The role of TA is typically assigned to faculty
      assistants, teaching assistants, or administrative assistants who
      help to develop and maintain course materials, communications, 
      assessments, and grades in a Blackboard course.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <em>Student</em>
      has access to content areas, communication and collaboration tools,
      and assessments, given the instructor has made these available to
      students. Students do not have access to the Control Panel. Only
      those with the role of Student can take assessments and have grades
      recorded in the Blackboard gradebook. Instructors can make grades
      available to students and the student will see only his/her own
      grades via a &quot;My Grades&quot; view.<br/>
      
      <em>Caution:</em> If you change the role of a Student who is enrolled
      in your Blackboard course to that of TA or Grader they will be removed
      from the gradebook and will not be able to submit work in Blackboard.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <em>Grader</em>
      is able to access all areas under Assessments in order to
      manage/assign grades.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <em>Course Builder</em>
      has access to most content functions. They cannot build assessments or
      pools, do not have access to the gradebook, cannot create calendar
      entries and course tasks, and cannot access course statistics.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <em>Guest</em>
      is defined by Blackboard, Inc. as a user in a course who do not
      directly participate in its activities. By default, Guest Access is
      turned off at the course level. Instructors have the control to turn
      this on or to allow/disallow guest access to specific areas and tools
      of the course.<br/>

    </li>
    
    <li>
      <em>Observer</em> is defined by Blackboard, Inc. as users in a course
      who do not directly participate in its activities but who follow the
      actions of one or more Students enrolled in the course. By default,
      Observer Access is turned off at the course level. Instructors have
      the control to turn this on or to allow/disallow observer access to
      specific areas and tools of the course.
    </li>
  </ul>
