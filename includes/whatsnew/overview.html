  <h1>Blackboard System Update</h1>

  <p>
    Recently, we installed system updates necessary for maintaining
    the stability and security of the system. If you would like help
    with your Blackboard course, please
    contact <strong>bb-help@andrew.cmu.edu</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> When you first login, you will notice an
    initial screen, imposed by Blackboard, Inc., that allows you to
    review a few of the settings. Once you hit the &quot;Close&quot;
    link provided, this screen will not reappear.

  <p>
    <strong>Instructors:</strong> As part of the system updates,
    Blackboard, Inc. has included an enhancement to the interface
    visual design. We want to make you aware that the changes in the
    user interface are almost entirely visual/skin. The position of
    your menus and content areas remains the same. The functionality
    is also the same. Within the content areas, however, the arrows
    for selecting functional menus will be visible only upon rollover.
