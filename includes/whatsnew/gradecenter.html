  <h1>New Grade Center Features</h1>

  <h2>Additional Default Grade Center Views</h2>

  <p>
    Blackboard 9.1 provides 3 default Smart Views of the Grade Center directly
    from the Control Panel: the original &quot;Full Grade Center&quot; view
    and the new &quot;Assignment&quot; view and &quot;Test&quot; view.
    Instructors can use these new views to efficiently view and navigate the
    Grade Center spreadsheet data.<br/>

  </p>

  <h2>Multiple Attempts</h2>

  <p>
    An &quot;Allow Additional Attempt&quot; option is new in that it provides
    instructors with a way to give more than one additional attempt to a
    specific student or for assignments and tests.<br/>

  <h2>Group Assignments and Grades</h2>

  <p>
    Instructors can create and grade group assignment(s) and can give one
    grade to a group which is then applied to all individual members of the
    group automatically.
