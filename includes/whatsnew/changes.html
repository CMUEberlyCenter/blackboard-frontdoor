  <h1>Where did it go?</h1>

  <h2>Digital Dropbox is No Longer Available; Use Assignments Instead</h2>

  <p>
    Instead of using the Digital Dropbox, which did not organize or associate
    submissions with student information in the Grade Center, Instructors can
    now use the <a href="../evaluate#assignments">Assignments tool</a> which does
    help with organization, association of student submissions with the
    student name, and with an easier way to download, provide feedback, and
    upload student work.
  </p>

  <p>
    When an instructor creates an &quot;Assignment,&quot; a Grade Center
    column is added automatically to the spreadsheet. Students can access the
    assignment through the content area where the instructor added the
    assignment and the instructor can monitor student submissions through the
    Grade Center spreadsheet view.<br/>
