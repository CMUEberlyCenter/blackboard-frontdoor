  <h1>New Interface</h1>

  <h2>Control Panel functionality available from left menu area</h2>

  <p>
    Instructors can now access the Control Panel functionality directly from
    the a course page. Located just beneath the Course Menu, instead of
    clicking a Control Panel button to go off to a dedicated screen, the
    Control Panel now expands to reveal its functionality.<br/>

  </p>

  <p>
    Blackboard has also reorganized and relabeled some of the functions within
    the Control Panel. For example, &quot;Assessments&quot; is no longer a
    category in the Control Panel. &quot;Tests and Surveys&quot; can now be
    found under &quot;Course Tools&quot; and the &quot;Grade Center&quot; is
    its own category.
  </p>

  <h2>Contextual menus make adding content a more efficient process</h2>

  <p>
    Buttons for &quot;Build Content, Create Assessment, Add Interactive Tool,
    Assign Textbook&quot; are exposed at the top of a course page when
    &quot;Edit Mode&quot; is turned &quot;ON&quot;. When moused over, each
    button expands to expose available options for adding content, tools, and
    assessments. Included in this version are some additional content, page,
    and tool types (e.g. syllabus, module page, journal).<br/>

  </p>

  <p>
    Contextual menus associated with the <a href="build#course_menu">Course
      Menu</a> make adding content areas a more efficient process as well.
  </p>

  <h2>New &quot;Drag and Drop&quot; functionality added</h2>
  
  <p>
    Drag and Drop functionality makes changing aspects of the course easy and
    efficient. With &quot;Edit Mode&quot; turned ON, instructors are able to
    reorder the course menu and content items directly by dragging content up
    or down to a desired location.<br/>
