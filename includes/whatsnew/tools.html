  <h1>New Tools</h1>
  
  <h2>Journals</h2>

  <p>
    A Journal is a self-reflective tool for students. Only the student and the
    instructor are able to comment on journal entries. However, journals can
    be made public by the instructor so that all enrolled users can read
    entries on a topic. Group journal entries can be read by all group members
    and the instructor.
  </p>

  <h2>Blogs</h2>
  
  <p>
    Blogs are a lightweight tool for facilitating student interaction and
    provide an easy way for students to share ideas. By default Blogs are open
    to all enrolled users in the course, but instructors have some options for
    controlling this setting.
  </p>

  <h2>Wikis</h2>

  <p>
    A Wiki is a tool that facilitates collaboration and provides students with
    an easy way to contribute and modify one or more pages of course-related
    content online.
  </p>

  <h2>Rubric</h2>

  <p>
    A Rubric is a tool that lists evaluation criteria for an assignment.
    Rubrics can help students organize their efforts to meet the requirements
    of an assignment. Instructors can use Rubrics to explain their evaluations
    to students.
