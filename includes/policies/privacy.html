  <h1>Student Information and Privacy</h1>
   
  <h2>Blackboard System and Administration</h2>
  
  <p>
    The administrators of Blackboard
    (<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/eberly">Eberly Center</a> and
    <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/computing/">Computing Services</a>) make every effort
    to minimize the amount of personal information about students and faculty that
    resides on the system. Only a <strong>user's name</strong>, <strong>Andrew
      ID</strong>, and an <strong></strong>internal CMU ID (not the user's social
    security number) is all that is required.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system is run under <strong>SSL encryption</strong> to protect all information
    passing to and from the system.
  </p>
    
  <h2>Student Privacy Policy (FERPA)</h2>
  
  <p>
    Faculty and students using the system should be careful to do nothing that might
    compromise the privacy of users. Faculty should familiarize themselves with the
    degree of class and public access that various choices in the Control Panel will
    permit. Specifically, please recognize that granting guest access will allow
    non-enrolled students access to many of the course materials.
  </p>

  <p>
    All information posted should conform to Carnegie Mellon's Student Privacy Policy:
    <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StPrivacy.html">http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/StPrivacy.html</a>

  </p>

  <p>
    This means that care needs to be taken so that no student information is posted in
    a way that other members of the class can access it. (A simple mistake might be
    something like putting up an Excel spreadsheet with student names, ID numbers, and
    grades.)

  <p>
    <em>Warning:</em> Safeguard private student information.
