  <h1>General Use</h1>
  
  <h2 id="general_use/policy">General Policy</h2>
    
  <p>
    No user or administrator of the Blackboard system should use it in any way that
    a reasonable person would interpret as:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Doing damage to normal access to, materials placed on, or the performance of the
      system.
    </li>

    <li>
      Infringing on the privacy of any user of the system.
    </li>
    <li>
      Infringing on the ownership and intellectual property rights of anyone who has
      placed materials on the system.
    </li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>
    The administrators of Blackboard (OTE and Computing Services) will make every
    effort to:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Safeguard the privacy of individuals using the system
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Limit access to materials placed on the system to the individuals specified by
      faculty who request course sites
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    There will be no unauthorized reuse, copying, or modification (i.e., removal from
    the system) of materials posted by either faculty or students on Blackboard unless
    those materials are part of a policy violation (e.g., intellectual property
    violation or violation of general Carnegie Mellon policies).
  </p>
    
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> If violation of policy has occurred, then notification will occur
    before materials are removed.
  </p>
   
  <h2 id="general_use/backup">Course Backup and Recovery</h2>

  <p>
    Although routine backups of Blackboard will be made, we cannot absolutely guarantee
    that any of the information placed on Blackboard will not be lost. For this reason,
    faculty and students are responsible for retaining their own copies of all pieces
    of information placed on the Blackboard system if loss of that information would
    prove damaging.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We emphasize to faculty that the grade book feature of Blackboard is intended for
    publication of grades for students and not as a secure, reliable repository of
    grade records.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Warning:</em> Faculty are responsible for their own course back-ups. Also,
    keep a backup of the gradebook after every grading change.
  </p>
    
  <h2>Course Access Privileges</h2>

  <p>
    Only faculty of record for a course can request that access be given to their
    course materials to anyone other than a student officially enrolled in the class
    (or provide access privileges through the administrative tools for their Blackboard
    course). The faculty making these requests or providing access privileges should be
    aware that they are thereby limiting our ability to prevent unauthorized access to
    materials and loss of critical materials from the system.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Warning:</em>Be advised to limit &quot;instructor&quot; or &quot;TA&quot;
    access as much as possible to those individuals who are completely competent in
    using the system.
  </p>
