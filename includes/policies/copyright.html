  <h2>Rights of Authors</h2>
  
  <p>
    Faculty and student authors of materials do not give up any rights to their
    ownership of those materials by posting them in Blackboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users of Blackboard must adhere to U.S. copyright laws in posting materials for
    which they do not own the copyright.

  <h2 id="copyright/fair_use">Fair Use</h2>
  
  <p>
    The &quot;fair use&quot; standards of the U.S. copyright laws allow the use of
    copyrighted material for certain educational purposes. The Blackboard system helps
    enforce fair use practices by limiting access to materials that you post to members
    of a particular class.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fair use guidelines require more than limiting access to a class. The way in which
    you use material is important. It is important that you adhere to the fair use
    guidelines in using <em>any</em> copyrighted material.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Warning:</em> Do not open access to guest users if you have chosen to use
    copyrighted materials for educational purposes in your class.
